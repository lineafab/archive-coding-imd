## Plan

→ I know that the archive has videos, records of the Mothers Earths meetings, I will like to listen/see them

→ The content of the magasin is the same subject as in many nowadays freedom speaker. 

→ 

→ I see a sculpture that capture the different aspect of the magazine. Sound, text, video. atmosphere from magazine making to the viewer. 

→ Reproduction of the magazine. The archive doenst have the physical magazine. 

→ Non linear narrtive - The mother Earth. The different medias that have being used. In the magazine. Always a new knowledges, you never know. 

→ imd: In the archive will never be a linear narrtive. its about perspective and personlily  opinon/direction. Can I use the way/function(machine) of used of the microfilm today?. To transcode this magasine in the future. installtion. circle experences. Where to break the cirle?

→ A book has it begnings and a end, but what if where is no way of start or endings? Emma Goldman's story has a starting point, but as she tell that her life start for real later in the her. She decidede when her life begins. (find the date Linea) 

**Archive Fever - Derrida** → He desricbe the similiarity between an archive and the human psylogi mind. How we capture, select, lost memory. That our urgent to control everything, but as Derrida desricbe that there will always be another perspective. 

Derrida asks what should be included in archives, where there are gaps, and what a Freudian archive might look like.
