# In between (Thoughs, Ideas etc): 

## Thought 


**→ Non linear narrative - The mother Earth.** The different medias that have being used. In the magazine. Always a new knowledges, you never know. 

→ imd: In the archive will never be a linear narrative. its about perspective and personally  opinion/direction. Can I use the way/function(machine) of used of the microfilm today?. To transcode this magazine in the future. installation. circle experiences. Where to break the circle?

→ A book has it begnings and a end, but what if where is no way of start or endings? Emma Goldman's story has a starting point, but as she tell that her life start for real later in the her. She decidede when her life begins. (find the date Linea) 

**Archive Fever - Derrida** → He desricbe the similiarity between an archive and the human psylogi mind. How we capture, select, lost memory. That our urgent to control everything, but as Derrida desricbe that there will always be another perspective. 

Derrida asks what should be included in archives, where there are gaps, and what a Freudian archive might look like.
